# 🌍 Top Countries by Population – SQL Data Dig

This project explores a custom dataset of countries using SQL. I created a table with details about several countries, including population, area, continent, and GDP per capita. Then I used different SQL queries to dig into the data and pull out interesting insights.

The goal was to practice using:

* `SELECT` with filtering and sorting
* `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`
* `CASE` statements for custom groupings
* Aggregates like `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`

### 🧠 Questions I explored:

* What’s the average population of the countries in the dataset?
* Which continent has the highest GDP per capita?
* Which countries are both densely populated *and* wealthy?
* How can we group countries into "Small", "Medium", and "Large" by population size?

This helped me get more comfortable with thinking like a data analyst—looking at numbers and asking questions to find stories inside the data.
